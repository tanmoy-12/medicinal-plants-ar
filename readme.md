# ðŸŒ¿ Medicinal Plants AR App

Welcome to the **Medicinal Plants AR App**, an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) experience built using **Unity** and **AR Foundation**. This app empowers users to explore and learn about medicinal plants by placing 3D models of these plants in real-world environments using their mobile device's camera.

## ðŸ“± Features

- **Plane Detection**: Users can scan their surroundings to detect horizontal surfaces like floors or tables.
- **Real-World Placement**: Once a plane is detected, users can select it and place 3D models of various medicinal plants directly onto the surface.
- **Interactive Experience**: Users can move, rotate, and view plants from any angle, enhancing learning through visual interaction.
- **Educational Insights**: Each plant model is associated with key medicinal properties and information, helping users understand its traditional and modern uses.
- **Multiple Plants**: Choose from a curated list of medicinal plants to place and explore.
  
## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Unity** (AR app development)
- **AR Foundation** (cross-platform AR framework by Unity)
- **ARCore / ARKit** (platform-specific AR support for Android and iOS)
- **3D Models** (optimized medicinal plant models for mobile AR)
- **C#** (scripting for interaction and UI)

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Open the App**: Launch the app on your AR-supported smartphone.
2. **Scan Your Environment**: Move your phone around so it can detect a flat surface using plane detection.
3. **Select a Plane**: Once a plane is detected, tap on it to lock it in place.
4. **Choose a Medicinal Plant**: A UI menu allows you to browse and select from a variety of medicinal plants.
5. **Place the Plant**: Tap on the screen to place the plant model on the detected surface.
6. **Explore**: Move your phone around to see the plant from different angles. Tap on the plant for information.
